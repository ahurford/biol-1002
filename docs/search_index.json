We will be focusing on manipulating and organizing data in tables, and learn a useful package called dplyr (pronounced “d-plier”) Install: R and RStudio (if you have not already). Read: Introduction to R - Workflow Introduction to R - Working directory Entering and loading data - Loading or importing data Entering and loading data - Inspecting the data Best practices Handling data Remember! The Quantitative Skills for Biology manual you used in BIOL 1001 is still online (and updated regularly). If you need to review how to install and use R, please the manual! You can access it here: https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/. When using R, you have many ways to get help. In addition, these labs are based on Week 3: Data in Tables (PART I) and Week 4: Grouping &amp; Joining Data (PART II) of the online course Data Carpentry for Biologists by Dr. Ethan White. If you are not sure how to execute a particular command, you can refer to the Lecture material on Dr. White’s website and/or his instructional videos that go with the relevant lessons. The example data in the lecture material and videos is different from the data you use in the exercise. After these labs you should be able to: install packages and load data, understand the data manipulation functions of dplyr, and execute a simple import and data filter scenario "],["part-i-managing-biological-data.html", "2 PART I: Managing biological data 2.1 Shrub Volume Data Basic 2.2 Mean maximum monthly temperature in Bay D’Espoir 2.3 Bird Banding 2.4 Portal Data Manipulation 2.5 Using pipes", " 2 PART I: Managing biological data Getting started Review best practices for guidance on how to organize your files. Download, to an appropriate folder, the following .csv files from Brightspace: shrub-volume-data.csv max-temperature.csv surveys.csv Open and save a new R Script. Complete the information at the start of the R Script template. Set your working directory Install and load the dplyr R package. If you’re unsure how to install a package, see R Packages. Throughout these instructions are links to the relevant sections in Quantitative Skills for Biology. If you do not complete these steps, you will not be able to complete the HAND IN questions. TO HAND-IN You are to hand in a .R file, formatted as shown in Best Practices - Template where the lines of code to produce the output asked for under HAND-IN are produced in the order they are asked for. 2.1 Shrub Volume Data Basic After writing the command library(dplyr) in your R script to attach dplyr, next import the data. If you use the programmatic way (i.e., command line), your command may look something like this: ShrubData &lt;- read.csv(&quot;lab_data/shrub-volume-data.csv&quot;) The exact command will depend on where you saved shrub-volume-data-data.csv and how you have set your working directory. You may call your dataset ShrubData or give it a different name. You will need this command in your R script or you will not be able to complete the HAND-IN questions that appear next. HAND-IN. [Q1] Add a line of code to your R script where you use the select() function to select the site and experiment columns of shrub-volume-data.csv (note: that above we named this file, ShrubData: you many have given it a different name). To learn how to use the select() function click on the select() link above. HAND IN. [Q2] Add a line of code to your R script where you use the mutate() function to create a column called area. (Reminder, the area of a rectangle is equal to the length * width). HAND IN. [Q3] Add a commented out line of code to your R script that answers the following question: does the arrange() function: (a) reorder all the rows in ShrubData based on the ascending order of the value in the width column, or (b) reorder only the width column? (for example, write # Q3. (a) in your R script if your answer is (a).) HAND IN. [Q4] Add a line of code to your R script where you use the arrange() function to sort the data based on the length column. HAND IN. [Q5] Add a line of code to your R script, where you use the filter() function to filter the data to only include plants with length longer than 5 cm. HAND IN. [Q6] Add a line of code to your R script, where you use the filter() function to show all entries with plants with length greater than 4 cm and width greater then 2cm. HAND IN. [Q7] Add a line of code to your R script, where you use the filter() function to filter the data to only include plants from experiment 1 or 2. HAND IN. [Q8] Add a line of code to your R script where you use the filter() function remove the rows with NA from your data. 2.2 Mean maximum monthly temperature in Bay D’Espoir In this section, we want you to use max-temperature.csv which you have already downloaded from Brightspace. Metadata Overview The data are from Bay D’Espoir GEN STN. and are originally sourced from Environment and Climate Change Canada. Bay D’Espoir general station is located in Newfoundland at -55.48 W Longitude and 47.59 N latitude. The station Climate ID number is 8400413 . The dataset provided, max-temperature.csv, is a cleaned version of the data download. Columns in the data frame Column 1: Year - The year of the recording Column 2: Month - The month of the recording, i.e. 1=January; 2=February; etc Column 3: Day - The day of the recording Column 4: Max.Temp.C - The maximum temperature recorded on that day in degrees Celcius. HAND IN. [Q9] In your R Script, indicate with a comment that you are starting a new section ## Maximum monthly temperature. Add lines of code to your R Script where you: load the data file: max_temperature_data.csv remove the NAs from the dataset using filter(). calculate the mean maximum temperature in each month across years using group_by() and summarize() as described in Group summary plot the monthly maximum temperature using plot(). 2.3 Bird Banding The number of birds banded at a series of sampling sites has been counted by your field crew and entered into the following vector. number_of_birds &lt;- c(28, 32, 1, 0, 10, 22, 30, 19, 145, 27, 36, 25, 9, 38, 21, 12, 122, 87, 36, 3, 0, 5, 55, 62, 98, 32, 900, 33, 14, 39, 56, 81, 29, 38, 1, 0, 143, 37, 98, 77, 92, 83, 34, 98, 40, 45, 51, 17, 22, 37, 48, 38, 91, 73, 54, 46, 102, 273, 600, 10, 11) Counts are entered in order and sites are numbered starting at one. In your R Script, indicate with a comment that you are starting a new section ## Bird banding. Review the section Useful functions. Add lines of code to your R Script where you provide the commands to answer the questions below. In a comment after each line of code for each question, write a comment giving the numerical answer, i.e., # the number of sites is 10. HAND IN. [Q10] How many sites are there? HAND IN. [Q11] What is the total number of birds counted across all of the sites? HAND IN. [Q12] What is the smallest number of birds counted? HAND IN. [Q13] What is the largest number of birds counted? HAND IN. [Q14] What is the mean number of birds seen at a site? HAND IN. [Q15] How many birds were counted at the last site? Have the computer choose the last site automatically in some way, not manually entering its position as a number. Do you know a function that will give you a position of the last value? (since positions start at 1 position of the last value in a vector is the same as its length). HAND IN. [Q16] How many birds were counted at site 42? 2.4 Portal Data Manipulation In this section, we want you to use surveys.csv, which you have already downloaded from Brightspace. In your R Script, indicate with a comment that you are starting a new section ## Portal data. HAND IN. [Q17] Add lines of code to your R script to load the file surveys.csv. HAND IN. [Q18] Add lines of code to your R script where you use filter() to create a new data frame survey_new where you have removed all rows with NA in the weight column. HAND IN. [Q19] Add lines of code to your R script where you use the select() function to create a new data frame called survey_new_2 that only contains the columns year, month, day, and species_id in that order. HAND IN. [Q20] Add lines of code to your R script where you use mutate() to calculate weight_kg, which is weight in kilograms, and add this new column to survey_new_2, where the result is named survey_new_3. The weight in survey_new_2 was given in grams, so you will need to convert weight into kilograms. (Recall that 1 g = 0.001 kg.). HAND IN. [Q21] Add lines of code to your R script, where you use filter() to make a new data frame survey_new_4 which is the same as survery_new_3 except that only the rows with species_id ==\"SH\" are included. HAND IN. [Q22] Add a line of code to your R script where you print the first 6 rows of survey_new_4 using the head() function. 2.5 Using pipes In your R Script, indicate with a comment that you are starting a new section ## Using pipes. HAND IN. [Q23] Add lines of code to your R script were you produce a data frame survey_new_5 from surveys.csv, which is the same as survey_new_4, but where you use the pipe %&gt;% operation and do not create the intermediaries survey_new_2, survey_new_3, and survey_new_4. HAND IN. [Q24] Add a line of code to your R script, where you print the first 6 rows of survey_new_5 using the head(). "],["lab2.html", "3 PART II: Managing biological data 3.1 Grouping and Joining Data", " 3 PART II: Managing biological data Getting started Review best practices for guidance on how to organize your files. Download, to an appropriate folder, the following .csv files from Brightspace: shrub-volume-data.csv shrub-volume-experiments.csv shrub-volume-sites.csv surveys.csv species.csv plots.csv Open and save a new R Script. Complete the information at the start of the R Script template. Set your working directory Install and load the dplyr R package. If you’re unsure how to install a package, see R Packages. Throughout these instructions are links to the relevant sections in Quantitative Skills for Biology. If you do not complete these steps, you will not be able to complete the HAND IN questions. TO HAND-IN You are to hand in a .R file, formatted as shown in Best Practices - Template where the lines of code to produce the output asked for under HAND-IN are produced in the order they are asked for. 3.1 Grouping and Joining Data 3.1.1 Shrub Volume Aggregation In this section, we revisit grouping data and using pipes. The following code calculates the mean width of plants at each site. Both the pipe operation method and the non-pipe operation method will be highlighted. # attach dplyr library(dplyr) # load the data shrub_dims &lt;- read.csv(&quot;lab_data/shrub-volume-data.csv&quot;) # Calculate the mean width for each site: ## 1. Without using pipes: by_site &lt;- group_by(shrub_dims, site) avg_width &lt;- summarize(by_site, avg_width=mean(width)) ## 2. Using pipes: avg_width_pipe &lt;- shrub_dims %&gt;% group_by(site) %&gt;% summarize(mean(width)) # Showing the first six rows with both methods head(avg_width) ## # A tibble: 4 x 2 ## site avg_width ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 1.67 ## 2 2 3.47 ## 3 3 1.43 ## 4 4 NA head(avg_width_pipe) ## # A tibble: 4 x 2 ## site `mean(width)` ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 1.67 ## 2 2 3.47 ## 3 3 1.43 ## 4 4 NA HAND IN. [Q1] Add a line of code to your R script where you use pipes to calculate the mean height of plants in each experiment, and use head() to print the output (the above code is intended as a guide you can modify). HAND IN. [Q2] Add a line of code to your R script where you use pipes to calculate the maximum, max(), height of a plant at each site and use head() to print the output. 3.1.2 Shrub Volume Join In addition to the main data table on shrub dimensions, there are two additional data tables: shrub-to-volume-experiment.csv, which describes the manipulation for each experiment; and - shrub-volume-sites.csv, which provides information about the different sites. Your are to use inner_join() to create a new data frame with the site details added. You can read about inner_join() here. HAND IN. [Q3]. In your R Script, indicate with a comment that you are starting a new section ## Shrub volume join. Add lines of code to your R Script where you: Import the experiments data, shrub-volume-experiment.csv and use head() to view the first six rows of data. View the first six rows of the data shrub-volume-data.csv (note that in the above code this was assigned the variable name shrub_dims). HAND IN. [Q4] In your R Script, add a commented out line of code where you provide the name of columns that appear in both data sets. HAND IN. [Q5] In your R Script, add a commented out line of code where you provide the values of the column with the same name that appear in both data sets. HAND IN. [Q5] Use the inner_join() function to combine the sites data with the shrub dimensions, shrub_dims data (note you may have given a different variable name to your import of shrub-volume-data.csv). Import the sites data, shrub-to-volume-sites, and then combine it with both the data on shrub dimensions and the experiment data to produce a single data frame that contains all of the data. Hand in the tail output of the new data frame. Hint: you’ve just created a single data frame that contains both the shrub and experimental data. 3.1.3 Portal Data Aggregation This exercise uses the survey.csv (Portal Teaching Database survey table) file you downloaded for last week’s lab. If the survey.csv is not in your workspace download it from last week’s Brightspace folder. In this section you will be using the group_by(), summarize(), tally() and filter() functions. More information about each of the functions can be found under the Help Tab or through the ?function and ??function commands. Examples for how to use the ? and ?? command are below. ?group_by ??group_by Hint: For this section it maybe useful to use pipe %&gt;% operations and the tally function. For example, I can tally the number of individuals that either identify as M or F in the sex column. survey %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% tally() ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## sex n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 &quot;&quot; 2511 ## 2 &quot;F&quot; 15690 ## 3 &quot;M&quot; 17348 HAND IN Do the following: Use the group_by() function to get a count of the number of individuals in each species ID. Include either the output or place into a table and include. Use the group_by() function to get a count of the number of individuals in each species ID in each year. Hint: you can group_by two variables. Include either the output or place into a table and include. Use the filter(), group_by(), and summarize() functions to get the mean mass of species DM in each year. Inlcude the tail output. Hint: double check the survey data is ready to use. 3.1.4 Fix the code This section is a follow up to the Shrub Volume Aggregation. The following code is supposed to import the shrub volume data and calculate the average shrub volume for each site, and separately, for each experiment. read.csv(shrub-volume-data.csv) shrub_data %&gt;% mutate(volume = length * width * height) %&gt;% group_by(site) %&gt;% summarise(mean_volume= max(volume)) shrub_data %&gt;% mutate(volume = length * width * height) %&gt;% group_by(experiment) %&gt;% sumarize(mean_volume = mean(volume)) # This is an example of a comment within code HAND IN: Fix the errors in the code so that it does what it’s supposed to. Add comments # throughout to indicate what you have corrected. A portion of your mark for this question qill be determined by the quality of the comments. 3.1.5 Portal Data Joins This exercise also uses the survey.csv you downloaded from last week’s lab, in addition to the files listed below. Make sure that you have downloaded and loaded these data frames into your R. species.csv plot.csv HAND IN: Using the data sets above, answering the following question Use inner_join() to create a table that contains the information for both the survey table and the species table. Include both the head and tail output of the new data frame. Use inner_join() twice to create a table that contains the information from all three tables. Include both the head and the tail output of the new data frame. Use inner_join() and filter() to get a data frame with the information from the survey and plots tables where the plot_type is Control. Include only the tail output of the new data frame. 3.1.6 Portal Data dplyr Review The following questions will be using the same data frames as 3.1.5 above:surveys.csv, species.csv, and plot.csv. HAND IN We want you to do an analysis comparing the size of individuals on the Control plot to the Long-term Krat Exclosure. Create a data frame with the year, genus, species, weight, and plot_type for all cases where the plot type is either Control or Long-term Krat Exclosure. Only include cases where Taxa is Rodent. Remove any records where the weight is missing. Include the head output and the length() of the new data set. entire Hint: it maybe easiest to use the pipe %&gt;% operation to create 3.1.7 Extracting vectors from data frames Using the survey.csv (Portal Teaching Database survey table): HAND IN Do the following Use $ to extract the weight column into a vector and rename into weight_vector Use [,] to extract the month column into a vector and rename into month_vector. Recall that in [x,y] x corresponds to the row, and y corresponds to the column. Extract the hindfoot_length column into a vector and calculate the mean hindfoot_length ignoring null values. 3.1.8 Building data frames from vectors You have data on the length, width, and height of 10 individuals of the English yew Taxus baccata stored in the following vectors: length &lt;- c(2.2, 2.1, 2.7, 3.0, 3.1, 2.5, 1.9, 1.1, 3.5, 2.9) width &lt;- c(1.3, 2.2, 1.5, 4.5, 3.1, NA, 1.8, 0.5, 2.0, 2.7) height &lt;- c(9.6, 7.6, 2.2, 1.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.5, 2.3, 7.5, 3.2) HAND IN a data frame that contains these three vectors as columns along with a genus column containing the name Taxus for all rows and a species column containing the word baccata for all rows.
